# Robocup_P.Rescue.2017_RPi.Python
This is a private repository that contains the backup files of the program used in Robocup Jr. NZ Premier Rescue Division by Minsu Kim. <br>
<br>
This branch contains a lot of open-sourced libraries that are free to use by everyone. This is just used as my backup directory, and I am NOT trying to make others think that all the libraries that this branch contains are mine. <br>
<br>
All the simple programs inside the 'Programs' directory are mine, and are meant to be using few libraries inside the 'Libraries' folder. <br>
